         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AT our laſt Writing it was thought, that Monſieur <hi>Montal</hi> would have beſieged <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> having taken the neceſſary Poſts for it; but by the great Care of the Prince of <hi>Vaudemont,</hi> the French have been diſappointed in their Deſigns, both upon <hi>Dixmuyde</hi> and <hi>Nieuport,</hi> in the laſt of which Places they expected little or no Gariſon, ſo that Monſieur <hi>Montal</hi> made the greateſt haſte he could thither; but finding the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Bellaſyſe</hi> in the Neighbourhood with a conſiderable Body of Troops, he marched back, ſending his great Cannon to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and he is thought to have rejoyned the Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> who is in conſtant Motion, and was yeſterday about <hi>Harlebeck</hi> near <hi>Courtray.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Vaudemont</hi> continues to obſerve him in his Camp at <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Earl of <hi>Athlone</hi> was yeſterday Encamped by the Village of <hi>Aubay,</hi> from whence he intended to march this day to his former Camp at <hi>Pont a Selle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yeſterday the Horſes were ſent from hence for <hi>Mechlin,</hi> to bring hither the <hi>Flanders</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, in which are 8 whole Canon.</p>
            <p>We have 11 Batteries playing upon the Enemy, (beſides 4 at the <hi>Brandenburg</hi> Attack) five of Mortars, and 6 of great Guns, moſt of which are employed in battering 2 Baſtions on each ſide St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> Port, where a conſiderable Breach is already made. This Work is ſeparated by a wet Ditch from the ancient Wall, within which the Enemy have likewiſe made a Retrenchment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſal</hi> is ſurrendred upon Conditions; one whereof is, <hi>That the Fortifications of the Town and Cittadel ſhall be demoliſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hague, July</hi> 26. The Letters from <hi>Flanders</hi> ſay, that the Count <hi>de Montal</hi> is retired from before <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> which the timely care of reinforcing the Gariſon, and the opening the Sluces, had ſecured from any attempt. The Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> had at the ſame time a deſign upon <hi>Nieuport,</hi> but the Prince <hi>de Vaudemont</hi> having ſent Sir <hi>Henry Bellaſyſe</hi> with 12 Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that way, prevented it, and the Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> returned towards <hi>Rouſclaer.</hi> They write from <hi>Madrid</hi> of the 7th of <hi>July,</hi> That a Regiment of 1000 Men were arrived at <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celona</hi> the 24th of <hi>June,</hi> New-Stile; and that the 29th, the Tranſport Ships, which had on Board the Troops from <hi>Final,</hi> appeared off <hi>Barcelona.</hi> Admiral <hi>Ruſſel</hi> continued on the Coaſt of <hi>Provence.</hi> The <hi>New-Spain</hi> Fleet would depart from <hi>Cadiz</hi> about the end of <hi>July.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paris, July</hi> 23. The Letters from <hi>St. Malo</hi> of the 17th inform us, that the Enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to Bombard the Town the 15th, and continued to do ſo all that day; We do not yet know all the particulars of the damage we have ſuffered; The Inhabitants were in a great Conſternation, and moſt of them retired to the Country, and they reckon that half the Town is deſtroyed. They write from <hi>Marſeilles</hi> of the 12th, that the laſt News they had of Admiral <hi>Ruſſell</hi> was, that the contrary Winds had carried him to the Gulf of <hi>Palma</hi> in <hi>Sardinia.</hi> The News is confirmed, that the Gariſon of <hi>Cazal</hi> has capitulated, and that the Town and Cittadel is to be demoliſhed. We are in great pain for <hi>Namur,</hi> and they ſay, there is a miſunderſtanding between the Mareſchal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> and Count <hi>de Guiſcard</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francfort, July</hi> 20. The two Armies continue in the ſame Camps you had an account of in our laſt; The French have ſent their Baggage over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and are laying two Bridges over that River near <hi>Ketch;</hi> but their Army will hardly be able to paſs it, without giving us an opportunity to fall upon their Rear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vienna, July</hi> 13. The laſt Advices from <hi>Hungary</hi> ſay, That the Imperial Army was march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards <hi>Peter-Waradin,</hi> and we conclude they are by this time near that Place. They write from <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> that General <hi>Veterani</hi> is marched with the Forces under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand towards <hi>Caranſebes.</hi> The Letters from the Turkiſh Frontiers ſay, that the Grand Signior was on his march towards <hi>Sophia,</hi> and would be at <hi>Belgrade</hi> about the beginning of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Turin, July</hi> 12. Our Troops before <hi>Cazal</hi> having puſhed on their Attacks with great vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, the Gariſon hung out a white Flag the Ninth Inſtant, and deſired to Capitulate; Hoſtages were given accordingly, and the Articles of Surrender were agreed on Thoſe of moſt importance contain, That the Fortifications of the Town and Cittadel ſhall be razed; And that ſo ſoon as that can be done, the Gariſon ſhall march out with their Arms and Baggage, 12 Pieces of Cannon, two Mortars, and ſeveral Wagons, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to <hi>Pignerol;</hi> The reſt of the Cannon, with the Proviſions of War, is to be left behind, whereof the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> is to have two Thirds, and the Imperialiſts and Spaniards the other Third. The Siege of this important Place laſted but 13 Days, and during it we loſt only 250 Men, beſides wounded. 'Tis believed, the Allies will undertake ſome new Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize before the end of the Campagne. Our Cavalry is Encamped at <hi>Buriaſque</hi>
